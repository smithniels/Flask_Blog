# Flask_Blog
Trying to understand Charles Leifer's code [app.py]. Storing on Github just to be careful!

I'm temporarily throwing in the towel on Mr. Leifer's blog and switching to another simpler type of blog [attempt.py] I found on Github.
As of 8/2/19, I have a page running on local host that will accept login's, accept blog entries, 
and post those entries back on to the main.html page.

Next steps: go through my list of TODO's and make the improvements to the page.
